<h5> Basic Exploration </h5>

The left half of the demo window is the 3D point plot.  The right half
is the semantic feature vector display.  At the bottom of the window
there are expandable panels that can be opened to reveal more advanced
features.<p/>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Explore the 3D point plot:</b> Click and drag in the point
    plot to rotate the view.  Use the scroll wheel to zoom in or out.
    Hold down the control key and click and drag to pan the view.<p/>

  <li> <b>Find closest words:</b> Put the mouse pointer over a word in
    the 3D plot.  A window will pop up showing the 10 closest words to
    this one.<p/>

  <li> <b>Explore the feature vector display:</b> The feature vector
    display in the right half of the window shows the embedding
    vectors for up to six selected words.  Drag the mouse over the
    colored bars in the display and you can read out the exact value
    of each bar.  The current column the mouse is over is magnified
    and shown to the left of the main display.  Column 126 correlates
    with gender; it is tan/orange for male words and gray/blue for
    female words.<p/>

  <li> <b>Focus on a specific feature:</b> To examine feature 126,
    drag the mouse across any of the six feature vector slots until the
    index reads 126. Then hold down the left mouse button to freeze
    the index and drag the mouse out of the feature vector display
    area.  Now you can compare the values of the feature without
    worrying that jostling the mouse will change the display.<p/>

  <li> <b>Add/remove words from the 3D plot.</b> Type a word in the
    text box below the 3D plot to add it to the plot.  Adding a word
    also makes it the active word.  If a word is already present in
    the plot, typing that word in the box deletes it from the plot.
    <p/>

  <li> <b>Activate a word.</b> Click on a point in the 3D plot.  This
  becomes the "active" word and its color switches to red.<p/>

  <li> <b>Copy the active word to the feature vector display.</b>
    When a word is active, you can click on one of the slots in the
    feature vector display and that word's vector will be copied into
    the slot, replacing the previous contents.  The word will also be
    deactivated.<p/>

  <li> <b>Compare word similarity via dot product (cosine
    similarity).</b> Load words into the six slots of the feature
    vector display. Then click on a word in the 3D plot to make it
    active, and read the similarity scores in red.<p/>  <p/>

</ul>

<h5> Analogies </h5>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Solve an analogy problem.</b> Open the Vector Analogy panel
    at the bottom of the display.  Type words into the boxes and click
    Submit to compute the result of the vector computation, shown in
    the 3D display as a pink node.  The closest known word to the pink
    node is shown as a green node.  If the answer is not what you
    expected, hover over the pink node to see what other words are
    close to it; the second or third closest word may be the correct
    answer.<p/>

  <li> <b> Examine the effects of vector arithmetic.</b> When solving
    an analogy problem, the third and fifth vectors in the vector
    display are the results of arithmetic operations.  The magnitudes
    of these vectors are shown in blue.  The magnitudes of words are
    always 1.0, but the artihmetic results can have magnitudes smaller
    or larger than 1.0.<p/>

</ul>

<h5> Semantic Dimensions </h5>

<ul>

  <li> <b> Select a different semantic dimension.</b> Open the Custom
    Semantic Dimensions panel and choose another dimension for the X
    or Z axis.  (The Y axis is the residual and cannot be changed.)
    See how the display changes.<p/>

  <li> <b> Alter a semantic dimension.</b> Open one of the feature
    subpanels and examine the word pairs used to define the feature.
    You can change these pairs to alter the semantic dimension.  For
    example, adding man/woman to the Gender dimension makes "gender"
    less clear and diminishes the residual, because "man" has multiple
    meanings.<p/>

  <lI> <b> Define a new semantic dimension.</b> Pick a new semantic
    dimension that you can define using pairs of opposed words.  For
    example, you could define a "gerund" dimension with pairs such as
    eat/eating, speak/speaking, play/playing, run/running, and
    sleep/sleeping.  Then solve an analogy problem such as "eat is to
    eating as swim is to x" and you'll see that the verb and gerund
    forms are on opposite sides of the gerund dimension.<p/>

</ul>
